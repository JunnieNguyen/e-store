The solution includes two folders:
- server  : API and Web Application
- database: node_demo
please try to open file: "/demo/server/services/config.js" to setup: username & password & database name

For start review:
- open command line in folder: "/demo/server"
- type:	npm install

- then, api and web application will run on port 3000 by default
- to access web application: "http://localhost:3000/"
